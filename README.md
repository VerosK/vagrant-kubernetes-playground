# Kubernetes playground in Vagrant

This is Kubernetes playground - two worker nodes and one API server. 

I'm using it to evaluate some Kubernetes bits at home. 

I am also providing some Kubernetes training and this repository is used
as a playground during the training.

Requirements:

 * Vagrant, Virtualbox, Ansible
